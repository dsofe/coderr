It’s free, open source, and available on every major platform. As a result, if you do your analysis in R, anyone can easily replicate it.

A massive set of packages for statistical modelling, machine learning, visualisation, and importing and manipulating data. Whatever model or graphic you’re trying to do, chances are that someone has already tried to do it. At a minimum, you can learn from their efforts.

Cutting edge tools. Researchers in statistics and machine learning will often publish an R package to accompany their articles. This means immediate access to the very latest statistical techniques and implementations.

Deep-seated language support for data analysis. This includes features likes missing values, data frames, and subsetting.

A fantastic community. It is easy to get help from experts on the R-help mailing list, stackoverflow, or subject-specific mailing lists like R-SIG-mixed-models or ggplot2. You can also connect with other R learners via twitter, linkedin, and through many local user groups.

Powerful tools for communicating your results. R packages make it easy to produce html or pdf reports, or create interactive websites.

A strong foundation in functional programming. The ideas of functional programming are well suited to solving many of the challenges of data analysis. R provides a powerful and flexible toolkit which allows you to write concise yet descriptive code.

An IDE tailored to the needs of interactive data analysis and statistical programming.

Powerful metaprogramming facilities. R is not just a programming language, it is also an environment for interactive data analysis. Its metaprogramming capabilities allow you to write magically succinct and concise functions and provide an excellent environment for designing domain-specific languages.

Designed to connect to high-performance programming languages like C, Fortran, and C++.
